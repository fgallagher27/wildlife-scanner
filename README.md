# :elephant: wildlife-scanner :monkey:

This repo is my attempt at the DrivenData Conser-vision Practice Area: Image Classification competition. I built a convolution neural net to identify wildlife from camera scan images.

**TODO** Setup / interacting with the code

**TODO** Performance

**TODO** brief summary of modelling and link to model itself
For a more detailed look at the project, please go to [`model.ipynb`](model.ipynb) for my attempt, or [`benchmark.ipynb`](benchmark.ipynb) for the benchmark provided by DrivenData.
